DESCRIPTION
***********************
This project was done as a third assignment for my AI for Game Programming class. The assignment was to procedurally generate 5 binary dungeon maps of at least 200x200 size using a quadtree. Then, using a tile/map editor, recreate one of those five maps. Once all of that is complete, write a brief report detailing the structure of the code and including all of the maps.

One thing I strive for in almost all of my coding projects is readability - I want anyone to be able to know what the program does line by line, which explains why I comment as much as I do. In this assignment, I sacrificed some efficiency in time and space for the sake of readability, but I attempted to make up for it by making sacrifices in favor of both time and space in other places.
